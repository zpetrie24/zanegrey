		Zane Gray Deep Dive
	</title>

	<h1> Reflection </h1>
	<p>I’ve spoken about Zane Grey plenty of times before. I’ll admit, I bet I’ve bored my peers with the trivia that he was one of the sole inspirations of my own name. Even if I claimed to have been named after him, I haven’t delved too far into his history as an author, fisherman, or game hunter. Before researching his history, I had assumed most of his exploits originated from the Southwest regions of America. However, there are documentations of Grey fishing for swordfish in Australia, residing in the deep woods of Northern Canada, and even spending his young adult life on the baseball diamond.
	Grey became a minor league player by absolute chance. He was spotted tossing potatoes at peers that he found undesirable by Arthur Irwin, that saw to Grey’s eventual succession of their team’s pitcher. He had a signature drop pitch that caught opponents off guard, and later his cardiovascular strength would prove his worth in the outfield. My history with baseball was not even remotely close to as impressive, reaching it’s prime in Little League, though to hear of how Grey’s resilience came from a result of sportsmanship explains his future exploits of chasing wild game on the plains in a better point of view.
	My mother has followed some aspects of his life really closely, even partaking in backpacking journeys on the bottom of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as a young adult. While she wasn’t much into hunting and fishing as Grey was, she did come to appreciate his outlooks on life and education, as a result of this deep dive, so have I. Growing up, I too had an affinity of nature. It was through my mother that I had first learned of Grey, after asking the classic question “Where does my name come from.”, digging up memories of her backpacking journeys of the Southwest. I never had the opportunity to sit down and hear one of her own stories from start to finish, as my mother is storyteller who prefers to tell her work in fragments.
	A line I never thought I’d draw was Zane Grey to Zanesville. It sounds made up, but the more it came up the more I had to come to terms that something so dorky was actually the truth. “Grey was born in Zanesville, O., January 31, 1875, the son of a doctor who had been a backwoodsman. His mother, Alice Josephine Zane, was a descendent of the Zane for whom Zanesville was named, and through her he inherited Indian blood which showed in his small, wiry figure, dark eyes and hair, and his inborn instinct for the wilds.” (Wellman). It turns out, Grey’s first name was a result of the small Ohio town. I’ve been to Zanesville, summer of 2022. It’s a very aged town, large hill in the center of everything that made traversal slightly difficult. It was a brief visit, and at the time I had not been aware of the connection between the writer and the town. The area around was densely wooded, and even in today’s world Zanesville still caried that feeling that brought it close to nature. In fact, the town was worn by the changing world that I’d imagine a Grey would’ve found a closer connection to the roots he had claimed to have, if it weren’t for this century’s recent boom in technology.
Grey did not grow to appreciate the outlooks of his own father, Lewis M. Grey, who had intended for his son to follow in his own footsteps by studying to become a dentist. Grey valued his education, so he followed his father’s footsteps loosely and attended Pennsylvania State University, where he would learn more about his passion for writing and temporarily take up the baseball bat and glove. Grey was not much for the lecture halls or the Chemistry related topics that his parents had subjected for him to follow.
	Upon graduating in 1896, instead of continuing to live the life his father wanted for him, Grey took off and wrote his first book in the Southwest. Instead of earning money to survive, he wrote and barely starved in New York. Grey didn’t take “no” for an answer when publishers originally shut him down, just as he didn’t take being a dentist as his passion. If Grey wanted something done, he’d see it done. This aspect of Grey was one of the more prominent details that overlapped on nearly all of the sources I’ve gathered so far. “Mice scampering about the cold floor of my New York flat were the witnesses to how I burned the midnight oil on that first book.” (Grey). His defiance to his parents’ dismay, was difficult to pull through. It tends to happen when one goes against the flow and forge a path of their own making. Grey’s first publication did not come close to easy to, as he had dozens of rejections and eventually insisted that Harper & Brothers would reevaluate their poor decision in a rejection. 
	Grey wrote before his travels to the Southwest too, though his golden goose was Riders of Purple Sage (1912) as a result of his explorations and eventual friendship with “Buffalo Jones”. Grey and Jones ended up living together as they explored the nature of the plains. Jones was renowned for being the man who wrestled and bound (mountain) lions, one of the most interesting characters Grey would come across through his travels. It raises the questions of whether he inspired any great characters of Grey. “Zane Grey’s heroes are noble and his villains deep-dyed. His heroines are beautiful and good. But there is a ring of deep sincerities in his books which must be the secret of their success. After all the public knows and appreciates sincerity and has an almost uncanny ability to find and reward it.” (Wellman). Grey paid great attention to his life experiences, and a great truth of self-journey can be found in his work and writing.
	One of my favorite sources to read from originated from Smith’s Weekly in Australia, which covered Grey’s fishing expedition in the area where he pursued the swordfish. The lampoons that the journalist Bruce A. Walker slung at the other journals throughout were hilarious, calling out the overconfident journals that at first “laid claim” to Grey’s current plans and writings. Grey went along with a “first come, first serve” idea, until he finally realized just how ridiculous the other reporters were over making public territory into their own exclusive domain. Grey would much rather be out on the water, fishing, than listening to a group of loud Australians verbally squawk over who can and cannot speak to the since renowned writer. Grey probably put his face in his palm more times than he had been published that loud Winter.
	Grey’s immense affinity towards nature, his very complicated history, and adventurous soul were what brought The Last Trail (1909), Wildfire (1910), and Riders of the Purple Sage (1912) to the world. With such a broad horizon on the world and strong self-morals, he had proven himself a strong writer to look up to. Not succumbing to any ideology but his own in his youth, being able to recognize what he valued at such a young age, and making the most of his higher education so he may further enhance his writing capabilities: all properties of having a strong soul. Grey wasn’t a man that could be tied to one location easy.</p>

<h1>Holmes, Fred L. “How Zane Grey is Discovering Our America.” The Farmington Times, August 1924. </h1>

	<p>Budding young manhood, Zane Grey was a baseball star. Had he continued, he would doubtless made a major league. His ability to throw a “crooked” ball attracted the attention of one of the graduates of the University of Pennsylvania who was witnessing back-lot ball game. This man induced Grey to go to college. Those were the days when the alumni were on the lookout for lads who would score in athletics and place high the record of their Alma Mater.
	“I hated the college lecture rooms” Grey went on. “I could not listen. My thoughts wandered afar, if not in green fields and quiet woods. Then in dreads that might come true. I was a poor student. I was shy and different. I never came to notice at college until Arthur Irwin, the famous roach of baseball at the University of Pennsylvania, sought me out. He caught me throwing potatoes at some students who were trying to capture me in a hazing affair. I was hitting every pursuer as he advanced. Irwin saw in this feat athletic possibilities.  So I got on in college in spite of the fact that I was out of my elements.”
	“I shirked the quiz classes and the laboratories. But somehow I passed my examinations, perhaps through the grace of my professors. One of the old sages remarked to me, ‘Well, Grey, you know a heap more about baseball than you do about chemistry.’”
	“The one place at Pennsylvania that I loved was the library. I used to go there and sit awhile in the subdued light of the domed edifice, feeling a stranger and a deep force, inscrutable and perplexing, at work within me. I seldom read anything. I always slipped in there when I was depressed and unhappy and seldom did I leave without having received some hope, some subtle intimation of the future. But even then did I not realize that literature was my calling.”
	After he had graduated, he played professional baseball with the Newark Eastern team, the Findlay Tri-State League and the Jackson Michigan League. Then he went to New York to practice dentistry. He entered to profession at the request of his father but didn’t like the work. R. C. Grey, his brother, the professional baseball player, helped him get established. Patients became to come. Meantime he kept wanting to do other things. At his brother’s suggestion, he wrote the store about Betty Zane, the famous sister of his grandfather.</p>

	<p>As a writer of outdoor yarns, particularly those of the great West he knows so well, Zane Grey is firmly established in the minds and hearts of millions of reders.
	In “Born to the West” which comes to the Empress Theatre for an engagement of three days starting Thursday net, those qualified to judge, feel hat he has evolved to one of the ost entertaining and true-to-life stories thus for written.

<h1>Walker, A. Bruce. “ZANE GREY Spills the Beans,” Smiths Weekly, January 1936.</h1>

	<p>There’s been such a lot of bally-hoo printed in the Press of Australia—mainly in the “Sun” and “Telegraph” in Sydney, and the “Herald” in Melborn, with its chain journals in the other States—hat “Smith’s decided to find out for itself if Zane Grey was just what there papers made out he was. He’s not. He’s a real big He-man. “Smith’s” here gives the real story of Zane Grey the man, and the Zane Grey whom the Melborne “Herald” tried to nobble—but couldn’t. The Melbourne “Herald authorities had the colossal impertinence to order “Smith’s” men off the field, but naturally nothing happened. Zane Grey received “Smith’s” with open arms, and this paper got the real story—a worth-while story, not the guff that the “Sun” and the “Telegraph” and Melbourne “Herald” print, and to which they endeavor to add dignity by putting the line “copyright” over the top of it. “Sloppyright” is the word.
	Two hundred and sixty miles south from Sydney, on a hill overlooking the Pacific on one side and the fishing village of Bermagui on the other is the elaborate camp of Zane Grey, famous author and big game hunter of the seas.
	There the American has striven to seek seclusion until he is ready to chase the swordfish and mako sharks that abound around Montague Island at this time of the year. But the privacy he desires is not his, for, daily, hundreds of curious people wander through his camp and stare at him as he sits at his desk in a big margueee dictating chapters of his new book to his attractive young secretary Maia Turnbull.
	When “Smith’s” say Mr. Grey in his camp and requested an interview, he said “I am sorry, I cannot talk. I am tied up with the Melbourne ‘Herald’.” But later he did talk. And spilled the beans properly. Despite the fact that other papers have quoted Mr. Grey, this is the first time he has been interviewed in Australia.
	It was late at night when “Smith’s” arrived at the Bermagui Hotel, where an argument about swordfish was in full swing in the parlor. Even at 3 o’clock in the morning one man could be still heard wanting to be  bucks and dollars that Zane Grey’s record mako shark was only in napkins compared with the one that got away from the speaker. And while they argued, Zane Grey was fast asleep dreaming of swordfish with beards on them like Santa Claus. At the Hotel Bermagui one gets swordfish and mako sharks for every meal. But the guess supply them—in fish yarus!
	In the early morning “Smith’s” paid its first call on Mr. Grey. On a hill 300 yards from the hotel we found his million-dollar cap of nearly a dozen tents, a kitchen, storeroom, 1000 gallon tank, etc., pitched under a natural canopy of shade created by huge bloodwood stringy bark and mahogany trees.
	Seated at a table in a big marquee, and surrounded by a hundred fishing rods, we found him. Broadshouldered, sturdily-built, with brown weather-beaten face, steel grey hair hanging over his forehead and keen, piercing eyes half-hidden behind dark horn-rimmed glasses, and dressed in open shirt and checkered sweater, he presented a typical picture of the man who has lived a clean, healthy, outdoor life.
	He greeted us in friendly manner, but—he was bound by contract to the Melbourne “Herald”.
	“I am sorry,” he said, “I cannot talk.”
	So we had a little chat instead.
	“What do you think of Australia and Australians?” we aske, just by way of breaking the ice.
	“Fine, both fine.” he simply said.
	“And er… do you, er… find the flies (the place was alive with them) worry you much?” We argued to ourselves that Sir Keith Murdoch couldn’t object to that since they were New South Wales flies.
	“Not at all,” he drawled; “not after having put up with them in some parts of Canada and Labrador.”
	We were getting on fine, so we dropped the chat and started to talk.
	“When do you expect to go out fishing?”
	“I am sorry,” he said, “I cannot talk.”
	However, as an after-thought, he added, “if you would care to talk to anyone else around the camp you can go right ahead.”
	We had a look at Peter Williams, Mr. Grey’s right-hand man and boat man.
	Peter, however, was very reticent.
	“Can’t tell you anything about the boss’s plans.” he said. “All I know is he’ll go out when the urge strikes him.”
	So we tried the cook. But all we elicited from Mrs. Roy was that she was looking forward to the trip to the Great Barrier Reef.
	Then we met Mrs. Anderson, wife of the chief lens lad looking very attractive in bright blue slacks. She was enthusiastic. In her rich, American drawl, she told us that the South Coast scenery was swell—just positively fascinating, and that all the tents in the camp were going to be named after the titles of Zane Grey’s books, or the characters in them.
	Mr. Grey, we learned, generally is easy to please, although he has fads about food.
	He has only two meals a day, missing out lunch, and is intensely fond of soups and milk foods. He loves cream, and bread plastered with butter, and if custard is on the menu he sends his plate back for a second helping. For breakfast he prefers porridge, followed by a nice steak, or bacon and eggs. He is a whale on tinned spinach (his larder is filled with cases of it), ham (there are enough hams hanging in his storeroom to feed an army), and apples while he never drinks anything stronger than milk or cocoa. He does not smoke, but, like most Americans, he chews gum. 
	This paragraph is inserted because it is just the sort of “stuff” the dailies like to print. We waive all copyright to that par.
	Next day we paid our second call on Mr. Grey.
	Walking though the camp we came across young Paddy Byrne, the most envied kid in Bermagut. Paddy has been employed by Mr. Grey to sweep up the dead leaves round the camp and burn them. With his little chest stuck out he was plying the rake before the jealous eyes of his mates.
	Paddy is firmly convinced that Mr. Grey is “a bonzer bloke.”
	We again found the American sitting in his “wigwam” with a retinue of servants around him. He was humming a camp song. Our minds flew back to Sitting Bull the prairies, the mesquite, the sly coyote, and the buzzards that hovered aloft.
	He was alternately going through his fan mail and signing autograph books for the children of the village. Not once has Mr. Grey refused to sign his name, or to speak to any stranger who approached him.
	“Good morning.”
	“Good morning.” he returned.
	“It is beautiful weather, Mr. Grey.” we ventured. “We thought you might be stirring up those swordfish today?”
	“I am very sorry,” he said, “but I cannot talk to you.”
	And it was such a pleasant morning too—the sun shone brightly from a cloudless blue sky, while kookaburras and gally-colored parrots fluttered from tree to tree.
	During the afternoon—from information received—we wandered up to the late camp again.
	Fifty yards away we paused under the shade of a huge bloodwood tree. Through his glasses Mr. Grey peered back at us, and then, as if making a sudden decision, he came towards us.
	“Look here, you chaps.” he exclaimed. “I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t speak to you. That fellow from the Melbourne ‘Herald’ keeps coming up here complaining about me allowing you to enter the camp. I have no objections to you being here whatever. Besides, it is a public reserve. I cannot understand the attitude of the ‘Herald.’ I only sold them the story I am going to write myself, and I don’t see why they should suggest that I give no interviews and allow no pictures to be taken. So if you want to take any pictures, boys, shoot, just shoot.”
	And while we were shooting, Mr. Grey also bemoaned the fact that the Melbourne “Herald” might syndicate his story. And he wasn’t even consoled when a local fisherman walked up and presented him with a 20lb blue groper.
	Then the swordfish king turned his attention to the Sydney dailies.
	“I want you boys to do me a favor,” he said. “Would you tell that person down the road who is sending messages through to the Sydney papers, to come up and see me first. Hell, he can’t do that!”
	The “Sun” and “Telegraph” according to Mr. Gray have been the worst offenders.
	For several days in succession the “Telegraph” said that Mr. Grey was going out after the swordfish “tomorrow”. It was the tomorrow that never arrives.
	Associated Newspapers’ “special representative” in Bermagui is not a pressman, but a local businessman. Sydney papers rang him and asked for any news. So he gave it out. Each time the notice appeared in the paper a crowd flocked to Bermagui, and, of course, spent money.
	Then when the “tomorrow” business became a bit worn, the “Sun” and “Telegraph” invented heavy rain at Bermagui.
	Thursday’s “Telegraph” of last week said, “BERMAGUI SOUTH, Wednesday—Heavy rain set in today, but if the weather abates, Zane Grey will probably start fishing tomorrow.”
	That particular Wednesday in Bermagul was, perhaps, the most glorious on record. The sun shone brilliantly, the blue sky was cloudless, and the sea calm.
	The next day the “Sun” attempted to back the “Telegraph” lie up with another one, by stating that a strong north-easter was blowing the rain away.
	Naturally, Mr. Grey is disgusted. Australia, according to Mr. Grey, is “sure fine.”
	“The South Coast scenery is beautiful.” he said. “so soothing and inspiring. I am very happy here, although I haven’t been too well lately. However. I am picking up now.”
	We referred last week’s “Smith’s” story on sheep rustling to Mr. Grey and he read it with great interest.
	“You mightn’t believe it,” he said “but cattle rustling and sheep stealing are almost things of the past in the[…]”

<h1>Maegraith, Kerwin. “Zane Grey in Wonderland,” The Sydney Mail, August 1936.</h1>
<p>The famous author and fisherman sat in the corner of the big room and plaited two rope-ends together. Outside, the cold, howling wind whistled through the trees.
	“How would you like to be outside in that?” I said.
	“Gosh, that is nothing,” he replied; “a bit choppy, that’s all.”
	I had often wondered why “Zee Gee” is so passionately fond of the open air. He went over to the window and gazed over the sea. “Pull up a chair.” he said.
	Then Zane Grey squatted down and told me of his early life. How, when he was but a tiny child of three, he would babble away to old ladies about “bars” and “bufflers”. “I guess I have always wanted to hunt those bears and buffaloes,” he drawled. “And I still do.”
	The family of Zane came from Zanesville in Ohio. “Zee Gee’s” great-grandfather married a half-Indian, so, as he says, the free life of the wide open plains is in his very blood. Ever since he can remember he has wanted to write books. To oblige his father he went to a university where he graduated. But the call of the open countryside was too great to resist, and much to the disappointment of his folks he broke loose and made for Pennsylvania. For seven eventful years he toiled away in the bush writing stories. He had no one to encourage him and he went through times where he was hungry and poor. During that time he finished his first book. It was called “Betty Zane”.
	With great excitement he stormed the publishers. They would not listen. His name was not known and they would not recognize him. But when Zane Grey sets out to do anything, no power on earth will stop him. He borrowed enough cash to talk a small printer into publishing his book. He then got married. “Betty Zane” was at first not a success. The sales were poor, but he dd not lose heart. He had written the story about his ancestors and felt sure of success. Gradually the book began to take on, then became a triumph and is still selling. That instance is typical of the thoroughness of the author.
	As fate would have it, a fine old plainsman from the west went to New York. He was “Buffalo Jones”, and he told the New York sportsmen of the times that he had lassoed live lions—the mountain lion of America—in the mountains in the Canyon country. The old man told how he had tied up the lions when they were alive, and the New Yorkers laughed. This aroused the interest of young Grey. He decided that he would find “Buffalo Jones” in his canyon haunts. When he arrived at the ranch of the old-timer, he found him very ill. He nursed him back to health and the two formed a close formed a close friendship. Eventually “Buffalo Jones” took Zane out west with him.
	“May I write your story?” asked the young writer.
	The hardy old man was cautious. “Can you write” he asked.
	So Zane Grey went out to the hair-raising adventures of a long stay at a ranch on the northern rim of the Grand Canyon in Utah. He and his friend old “Buffalo” crossed the desert with a caravan of Mormons. Zane lived among the Mormons for a long time and learned to like them. They told him their history, and from them he got stories and background for some of his most popular books. “Buffalo Jones” tied up ten monster live lions—they are of the panther family—during that trip, and his skill amazed young Grey. Zane’s story “Heritage of the Desert” is one of his greatest Mormon stories. 
	Both Zane and his brother R.C. who died not long ago in America were clever baseballers. The family is noticeable for their dark hair and dark skin. “Zee Gee” is now silver in the hair, but the early pictures show him to have been a bright-looking youngster, with a black shock of hair and deep-set eyes.
	All his life the author has been the keenest fish-hunter. There are tales of the magnetism with which the reel and rod pulled the young man away from his studies. Fishing on the Delaware River, he chanced to meet Lena Roth. Lena was a post-graduate of the Columbia University. Not long after, she became Mrs. Zane Grey, and has ever since been a constant inspiration.
	To my mind, after meeting many authors in various parts of the globe, Zane Grey is the most fascinating of them all. He paints his characters with a reality that makes reading his work a sheer joy. He has never laboured under a strain to form his stories. His mind is for ever active, so much so that I wonder he gets sufficient sleep. He is first on the scene on every fishing trip. On one terrifically rough excursion off Bermagui he looked around to discover Ed. G. Bowen looking very pale and sick. They had been fishing for some hours and the Avalon had been bobbing up and own on the turbulent sea with disconcerting jolts. But Grey would not give in.
	“I feel awful.” said “Zee Gee”.
	Bowen hung on to his rod and replied, “So do I.”
	“We’ll give it a go for another hour,” said Grey.  An hour later Peter Williams put the craft about and made for the harbour. They did not catch a fish that da, but Grey was satisfied. He is a thorough sportsman. When he has landed a marlin there has ben a fight to a finish—you can see it by the blisters on his hardy hands.
	In 1938 there is to be a congress of international big-game fishermen in Sydney. To lead them Australia is getting Zane Grey. Big prizes will be given, and the men who come will be sporting ambassadors for Australia in the future. </p>

<h1>Wellman, Paul I. “Zane Grey Found Real Adventure and Romance in His Life.” October 1939.</h1>

	<p>You were likely to meet him in the most unexpected—and unpeopled—places. Out on the Pacific, with the scud from the whitecaps spattering the deck of his boat, or on the back of a toiling pony threading its way up the trail along the edge of one of his beloved sun-smitten mesas in the desert, or deep in a forest squatted over a fire with bacon frizzling in his frying pan and his rifle and rod near at hand—in any of these spots Zane Grey might be encountered.
	He was a part of the wilderness of which his stories breathed. A real outdoors man, who knew from personal experience every foot of the country concerning which he wrote, and the men and women who peopled the pages of his novels. His death, yesterday, at his home at Altadena, Calif, ended one of the remarkable stories of literature.
	Zane Grey is known as possibly the most popular writer of his day. His books sold almost 12 million copies, and his name on the marquee of a motion picture house was a more potent attraction than that of most of the great movie stars. Yet his rise was not easy. I came about after seven years’ struggle against large discouragements and bitter want.
	Grey was born in Zanesville, O., January 31, 1875, the son of a doctor who had been a backwoodsman. His mother, Alice Josephine Zane, was a descendent of the Zane for whom Zanesville was named, and through her he inherited Indian blood which showed in his small, wiry figure, dark eyes and hair, and his inborn instinct for the wilds.

Turning Point in Life

	The elder Grey desired his son to become a dentist and sent him to the University of Pennsylvania for training, but Zane early exhibited an ambition to write. His passionate faith in himself was the one thing which carried him through the discouraging days which were to follow.
	The future author was a natural athlete. He played in the outfield of the university baseball team with such skill that at his graduation he was offered a professional contract. Hoping to save money to start writing he accepted and played with Newark in the old Eastern league, in the Tri-State league and the Michigan league. Out of those experience grew some of his later books, such as “The Shortstop” and the memorable short troy “Old Well-Well”.
	Zane Grey might have gone to the major leagues, but he quickly gave up baseball and dedicated himself to his ruling passion. His first book was to be a novel based on the life of his grandmother, Betty Zane, the pioneer woman who had homesteaded where Zanesville grew up.
	“Breaking into authorship was the hardest struggle of my life,” he said long afterward. “Mice scampering about the cold floor of my New York flat were the witnesses to how I burned the midnight oil on that first book.”
	“A dozen publishers refused it. In desperation I borrowed the money and published it myself—and it is still selling.”

Two Books Given Away.

	That book “Betty Zane” was chiefly important because it gave the writer a waste of achievement and recognition. After it appeared there was no turning him back from the profession he had chosen.
	Two other novels were written by Grey, and to get them published he had to give each away. Then he decided he had to give each away. Then he decided that to really write of the West he must know it, so he packed his few belongings and went into the plains country. There he became acquainted with the late Col. C. J. (Buffalo) Jones, lived with him several months and wrote “The Last of the Plainsmen,” which also was turned down by the publishers.
	The series of disappointments would have crushed most men, but it only intensified Zane Grey’s determination. He began the wearisome task of writing a new book, this time in a cabin in the mountains, where the cold night air chilled the fingers that held his pencil.
	Zane Grey wrote with a pencil to the end of his days. In that cabin he had an old Morris chair, and he wrote on a plain board laid across the arms of the chair. The result was “The Heritage of the Desert,” his first great success. He took it to a publisher who rejected it, told him he could never hope to write, advised him to take up some useful occupation such as plowing corn, and left him momentarily stunned. His own account tells best how he felt at that moment:
	“I never again want to experience such a bad half hour. After seven years of bitter toil I had gotten nowhere—but, I had faith in my work. I went back to the publishers and insisted tha they read it again. Finally they agreed to publish it and it sold, sold, and kept on selling.”

Two Famous Best Sellers

	That was in 1909. The book has sold more than 1 million copies and is still selling. Yet even this success did not completely convince the publishers. Grey brought them “The Riders of the Purple Sage,” and again only his persistence induced them to publish it. The sale of this book has exceeded 1 ½ million copies.
	Those two books made Zane Grey the most widely read author in America. From then on the path ahead was smooth. Everything he wrote was eagerly accepted. In thirty-five years he produced fifty novels, most of them extremely popular.
	He became wealthy—at one time he incorporated himself with a capitalization of 3 million dollars. He had home at Altadena, Calif. Catalina island, Long Key, Fla., and Tucson, Ariz.  Some of these were palaces. Yet there was one thing to be noticed about them all. In each was Grey’s writing room. It as no such study as the motion pictures show as being the workshop of an author. There were no books in it, no ornaments, no pictures even. There were only plain walls—walls as plain as those of the cold mountain cabin where Grey wrote his first great successes. And in that plain room was an old Morris chair, and across the arms of that chair a plain board.
	In that one room Zane Grey recaptured the surroundings of the life he led when he first won success. Perhaps it was what the psychologists call a “conditioned reflex.” Perhaps he found he could not write in other surroundings. Perhaps it was superstition and he believed the bare walls and the faithful old chair and board brought him luck. But more likely it was the inner expression of the Zane Grey of the plains and mountains, the outdoors man who never could accustom himself to luxury and softness.

On Land and Sea

	In the years of his success Grey continued to live close to the Nature he loved. He fished in the Atlantic and the Pacific. His favorite quarry was the broadbill swordfish, one of the rare and extremely gamy big fishes of the world. He hunted all manner of big game all over the world. He plunged into forests, deserts, and mountains for the sheer joy of exploration. He loved better than any other thing a little tent pitched in the wilderness with a small fire flickering before it and the distant challenge of the coyotes whimpering down the canyon walls.
	Zane Grey’s life became somewhat scheduled as he grew older. A typical year saw him spending the months of January and February at Long Key where the balmy winds of the Gulf fanned him while he wrote, read, and fished. Long Key is a lonely white coral reef where few ever go, a prime consideration in Zane Grey’s mind.
	When spring came he traveled to Altadena, the home in which he died. There he wrote and studied, played tennis, and made excursions into the desert country across the mountains in Arizona and New Mexico.
	Early in June he was at Avalon. Catalina island, where he usually finished his current novel and went sword fishing. In September he went to Arizona and spent the fall there, returning to Long Key the first of the year.
	It was a pleasant round, full of variety and beauty. And all the time he was constantly collecting material for his novels. As he said himself:
	“There was never a ride without its profit to a seeing writer. Hazardous trails, spirited horses, mean mules, old-time cowboys, furnished just in the ordinary routine of travel more material for stories than I could use.”

Fifty Million Readers

	And his popularity grew and grew. In 1936 his publishers announced that the staggering total of 11,228,399 copies of Zane Grey novels had been sold. Allowing five readers to each book, that is more than 50 million readers—nearly half the population of the United States.
	And although high-brow critics lifted their eyebrows at Zane Grey’s writing, some of his novel are likely to last. “The Heritage of the Desert”, “To the Last Man” (which also sold more than a million copies), “Riders of the Purple Sage”, and “The Rainbow Trail” set a style and cadence to a whole school of writing which has placed its impint for good or ill on American literature.
	Besides his western stories, for which he was chiefly famous, Zane Grey wrote much about sports, including hunting and fishing articles and books, and several baseball stories culled out of his experience of minor league days. His wife, whom he married in New York in 1905, was the former Lina Elise Roth. She helped him, giving him many valuable suggestions on the manuscripts which he always read aloud to her, and what was more important, shielded him so that he could have time for work.
	As for his romances, he lived them all before he wrote them. There is no sex sordidness, or attenuated psychology observable in them. Zane Grey’s heroes are noble and his villains deep-dyed. His heroines are beautiful and good. But there is a ring of deep sincerities in his books which must be the secret of their success. After all the public knows and appreciates sincerity and has an almost uncanny ability to find and reward it.

<h1>Rider, Rowland W. “Enter Zane Grey.” 1985.</h1>

<p>Zane Grey entered into the picture during the trial of Jim Emett by the Bar Z Cattle Company which I mentioned previously. And Emett told me Grey had come from Ohio. His father had sent him from Ohio with a letter and $500 in cash to an old fraternity pal of his from the university who was now the presiding judge in Flagstaff, Arizona, and who presided at this trial of Jim Emett. And Zane Grey's father said in this letter, “The doctors here say that my son, Zane, has tuberculosis and won't last, only probably three months, maybe not that long, and if you will take care of him, or find some ranch out there that will take care of him until he dies, and bury him, you can have the $500. I've sent all the cash I could dig up with him, outside of his train fare, and if you'll see that this is done, I'll appreciate it very much." And that was the extent of the letter. So Zane had got there about two days before this trial and he was still living at the home of the judge. And the judge, by virtue of Zane being a guest in the house, got him a seat in the courtroom which was a very difficult thing to do because it was a notorious trial and all the cattlemen from all over the country came in there. They even built scaffolds up all around that courthouse on the outside to watch these proceedings through three big windows there.
Well, now, because this was the second time Emett had been brought in, they thought surely they'd get a conviction this time. That's what all the cattlemen were wishing, at least. So the judge had a good seat right near the witness stand for Zane during this trial. And after the second day of trial, the jury come in and ac quitted Emett. (This was one of the things Jim Emett was telling me on our trip back from Soap Creek to Lee's Ferry that night.) Zane Grey jumped up, shook Emett's hand and he says, “Mr. Emett, I feel like I know you from the evidence that's been brought out here in this trial and the description of Lee's Ferry and so forth." And he said, UI would like to go with you to your ranch. I have $500 and here's the letter that my dad wrote to the judge here and it specifies that you can have this money if you will take care of me until I die and bury me out there." And Jim Emett says, “You're my man."
So Zane Grey then went to Lee's Ferry. The old judge probably hesitated about giving him the okay on this trip, but Zane was determined to go. So that was how Jim Emett met Zane Grey. And every day then, now I don't know the exact number of days or the number of months, but Emett had Zane sleep out in the open, and every day he sent him up on the mesa to take care of a little band of sheep he had up there. Zane Grey'd go up there and herd those sheep every day and round them up at night and put them in a little corral there so the coyotes couldn't get at them and then he'd walk back down and he gained his health out there in the dry air and sunshine.
	And so this was the advent of Zane Grey into Arizona and also into his storytelling because, out of this experience, he became attached to the great outdoors and Arizona and the cowboys and the cowmen that he had met out there.
	Incidentally, it was about in 1907, two years before the event I've been telling you about of the Bar Z buying Emett out, that I first met Zane Grey. Now on the occasion that I'm talking about, the foreman of the Bar Z ranch, Dimmick, and I were camped at House Rock Ranch after having made a previous arrangement to meet within a two- or three-day period as there was no communication in the area except by word of mouth. And we were sitting by our small fire on the saddle porch of the rock house which is close to the corrals that I have spoken of, those tremendous corrals, inside of which was a reservoir and also pine watering tanks.
	It was dark and we were just ready to roll into our blankets when the big swinging gate creaked and called our attention to some intruder at the corrals. So I went down immediately toward the corral to see who it might be, as a stranger was welcome because I had been there four or five days alone before Dimmick came. And I wanted to see if it was someone I might know in the country. When I got there it was Jim Emett and Zane Grey. They had had time to water their horses and their packs, each had a pack, and were just coming out of the gate when the foreman of the Bar Z ranch approached. When he saw who it was, of course, he drew his six-shooter and he would have shot Jim Emett had I not kicked the gun out of his hand. I was sixteen years old but I was all muscle and had had good experience in wrestling and boxing, and I held Dimmick so that he couldn't recover his six-shooter. And Emett also carried a sixshooter, but Zane Grey begged him not to shoot Dimmick, the foreman of the Bar Z.
	Now the only thing I could say was, “Move on, because I can't hold this man forever." They mounted their horses and drifted. And they were going to meet Uncle Jim Owens with whom Zane Grey hunted lions. </p>

<h1>Pauly, Thomas H. “Wayward Youth: 1872-90,” Zane Grey: His Life, His Adventures, His Women. 2005. 16-17, 20-21, 22.</h1>
	<p>Having been raised in rural Ohio, Lewis, like Ebenezer and his brothers, was a hunter, and he introduced Zane to the woods at an early age. Though he was marginally literate (“I never [k]new a card”), he wanted to write, as a surviving poem about his dead mother and an account of his woodland walks verify. Religion was also important to Lewis. He attempted to be an itinerant preacher prior to taking up dentistry, and he taught regularly at the Mission Sunday School while Zane was growing up. A surviving three-page autobiography attests to his fundamentalist beliefs. In this curious document, which may have been written for a church event, Lewis announces his trust in the Lord, the importance of moral training, and the triump of his faith and hard work over his lack of education. He states that at the age of seven, he resolved to “be good, do good, and make something of his life,” and that at twelve, he vowed never to swear or drink. He maintains that temperance, morality, and religion enabled him “to rise in the world.” “I love cultured, talented society,” he admits, “but have had a hard struggle to get there. What I am I made myself, a self made man.” Despite Lewis’s fervent efforts to appear humble, his testimony contains telltale hints of the resolve and sternness that Zane would later resent.
[…]
An aged fisherman named Mudder Miser is presented as even more of a foil to Lewis Gray. Miser was an obvious vehicle for discussing his early interest in fishing, but Grey accentuates his difference from his stern, hardworking father. During a trip when he was only either, Zane saw his first fish. From his excited conversation with his mother, he leaned about Miser. When she characterized the stream containing the fish as “a bad place,” Zane pressed for more explanation. Groping for “the unfavorable impression that she knew would have pleased my father,” she informed him that Miser, who frequented the stream, was “a lazy, good-for-nothing fisherman” (I, 6). During a later outing, Lewis directed Zane’s attention to a poorhouse frequented by Miser and warned, “If you don’t learn to like work and study that’s where you will end p” (I, 7).
	Zane’s building resentment toward his fater discredited these negative appraisals and attracted him to this fellow outcast. Grey’s description of his first sighting of Miser is both poetic and mythic.
	“I was amazed to look up and see the strange figure of a man standing way out there where the water poured over the long fall. He stood up to his bare knees in the current that foamed around his legs. He was an old man, gaunt and bowed, and he pointed a long pole out over the swift water” Grey, (I, 9).
[…]
	The earliest surviving example of Zane’s writing is a verse he wrote in an autograph book for Anna Oldham at the age of twelve:
	“Friend Anna
	Remember this and bear in mind
	A good beau is had to find.
	But if your hand should choose to slip
	Catch another and let him rip.
		Yours Truly
		Pearl Grey”
Despite the obvious flirtation in this exercise of wit, Grey claims in “The Living Past” that he as not interested in the opposite sex until he was fourteen.
